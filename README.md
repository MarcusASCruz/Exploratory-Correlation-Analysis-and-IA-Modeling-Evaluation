# Exploratory Correlation Analysis and AI Modeling Evaluation

## Overview
This repository contains the code and notebooks for an academic study on using artificial intelligence models for inflow forecasting. The project explores various machine learning and deep learning approaches to predict water inflow, which is crucial for water resource management, hydroelectric power generation, and flood prevention.

## Project Description
The study focuses on:
- **Data Exploration**: Comprehensive analysis of hydrological and meteorological data
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigation of relationships between different variables affecting inflow
- **Feature Engineering**: Development and selection of relevant features for model training
- **Model Development**: Implementation and training of various AI models
- **Model Evaluation**: Rigorous comparison and assessment of model performance

## AI Models Covered
This research evaluates several state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning approaches:
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting decision trees for time series prediction
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**: Multi-layer perceptrons for pattern recognition
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Deep learning models for spatiotemporal feature extraction
